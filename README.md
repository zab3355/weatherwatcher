# Weather Watcher
Created a Node.JS application called Weather Watcher. This figured out what a user should wear depending on precipitation, and temperature. I used the Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMaps API. Included is a list of clothing based upon specific weather conditions (below 40 degrees long sleeve, above 40 degrees short sleeve shirt, to wear a heavy jacket or a snow/ice storm.)Â  Fontawesome icons included to show weather changes.
