# Weather Watcher
Created a Node.JS application called Weather Watcher. This figured out what a user should wear depending on precipitation, and temperature. I used the Google Maps API and OpenWeatherMaps API. Included is a list of clothing based upon specific weather conditions.Â  Fontawesome icons included to show weather changes.
